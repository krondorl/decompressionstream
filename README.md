# üì¶ DecompressionStream with gzipped text Example

Working code for [DecompressionStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DecompressionStream), which is a standard Web API.

DecompressionStream is already available in Baseline since 2023.

## Features

- üì¶ DecompressionStream (Web API)
- üìù plain text source file
- üóúÔ∏è gzip
- üìÑ single file

## üõë Warning

Before using CompressionStreams think about these compression topics:

- some compressed contents are single files,
- some of them can contain multiple files,
- others can contain folder structures with files,
- the algorithms can differ,
- streams and files are also different.

## Installation

Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally:

`npm install --global http-server`

## Usage

1. Run inside `src` folder: `http-server`
1. Open browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`
1. Select the `welcome.txt.gz` file from `data` folder and check its contents with this app.
